    <h3>Soccer is more than a game. It's a lifestyle!</h3>

    <h2>What is soccer?</h2>
    <p>
      Soccer, also known as football in most parts of the world, is a dynamic
      and exhilarating sport played between two teams of 11 players on a
      rectangular field, often referred to as a pitch, with a goal positioned at
      each end. The primary objective of the game is to score points by getting
      the ball into the opposing team's net, utilizing any part of the body
      except the hands and arms. Only the goalkeeper, positioned near the goal,
      is permitted to use their hands, but only within a designated area known
      as the penalty box. Matches are typically composed of two 45-minute
      halves, with a brief halftime interval, totaling 90 minutes of play.

      The simplicity of this sport has helped it become the most popular sport
      worldwide. Its accessibility means that whether in the streets of a
      bustling city, the beaches of a tropical paradise, or the rural fields of
      remote villages, soccer can be played anywhere, by anyone, regardless of
      social or economic background. However, it is a complex sport because of
      the refined skills needed to master dribbling, passing, positioning and
      strategic thinking. The art of teamwork and fluid movement on the pitch
      requires an exceptional level of technical ability, mental agility, and
      physical endurance, making every match an unpredictable and thrilling
      spectacle.
